Infographics require a lot of creativity and careful thought.  It is important to come to the table prepared and understand what you are looking to achieve.  An example of an Infographic is the [State of Storage Infographic](http://www.tegile.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/stateOfStorage_Full-1.png?target=_blank).  If this is more than what you are looking for, please consider the [Simple Graphics Request](#simple_graphics) Please ensure that you have the following before you make your request:

* Have the data categorized and laid out in the flow that you would like to convey
* Have a concept of what you would like the resulting graphic to resemble (examples help a lot)

#### Trade Show Graphics

Trade show graphics usually involve many different panels in multiple dimensions, which takes more time to create, review, and finalize each of the individual graphics. It also exponentially increases the chances of the printers coming back with requests or problems with the print files.  Please ensure that you have the following before you make your request:

* Printer identified (If not we can find a printer, but this will **add 1 week to the SLA**)
* Printer file delivery guidelines identified
* Booth config finalized
* Intended theme identified (ie: One Flash Platform; Compromise Nothing; etc.)
<br>

**Stages:** _Creation, Initial Review, Rework, Final Review, Optimization, Delivery/Publication_
<br>
**SLA:** _2 weeks_
